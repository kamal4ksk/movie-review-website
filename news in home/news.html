                  <p>The first season of House of the Dragon, over its ten episodes and two-month run, brought viewers once again to the continent of Westeros 
                    with all of its scheming. In terms of entertainment value, the series simmered and stirred but kept fans glued till the very end. The final two episodes 
                    saw the stage getting set for the Dance of Dragons with Queen Alicent (Olivia Cooke) usurping the throne for her son, Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) from the 
                    rightful heir, Queen Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy). However, war was not declared officially till the finale's bleak events over the skies of Storm’s End.<br><br><br>

                    During the season finale, Rhaenyra dispatches her sons, Jacaerys (Harry Collett) and Lucerys
                     (Elliot Grihault) to affirm the loyalty of her bannermen. Jace was sent to Winterfell (House Stark) and The Vale (House Arryn), 
                     and Luke was sent to Storm’s End (House Baratheon). However, Luke meets his uncle, Aemond Targaryen (Ewan Mitchell) and soon, due to past discretions,
                     
                     the pair end up in a battle in the skies that ends with Luke’s death. Fans of the book already know his mother’s vengeance will be dark and will come in the 
                     shape of two characters, Blood and Cheese, which House of the Dragon writer Sara Hess has confirmed, Per Variety, will be featured in the second season. 
                     Hess revealed “We are currently writing the finale of Season 2,” Hess told Variety then added about the infamous Blood and Cheese story. “I don’t think you will be disappointed.”<br><br><br>
                    
                    As earlier mentioned, fans of George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood already know the danger these two characters pose. In the aftermath of Luke's death, the Blacks led by Rhaenyra would 
                    employ the services of these two individuals to execute a brutal reparation for the death of her son. Given that the fanbase has been promised not to be “disappointed”, maybe we might be
                     set for a gruesome vengeance scene when the show returns. One that was described by the source material’s Prince Daemon as being “An eye for an eye, a son for a son.”</p>

                            <p>As the year comes to an end, James Cameron's epic sequel continues to splash across the world as Deadline reports that Avatar: The Way of Water has now grossed over $1.1 billion at the global box office 
                                on its 15th day of release after an additional $70.5 million on Wednesday. Of its overall total, $762.8 million comes from international markets, which puts the film on track to become the biggest international release of the year.<br><br><br>

                                Despite its lower-than-expected opening weekend of $134 million, the movie continues to dominate the box office with solid legs. Domestically, the film has earned $337.9 million so far, which puts the movie on track to surpass
                                 Thor: Love and Thunder's $343 million. Whether the film will be able to beat Top Gun: Maverick's $718.7 million remains to be seen. However, Avatar: The Way of Water currently paces 1% behind the previously mentioned film and has earned the best Wednesday of the year this week with its $20.4 million, topping Maverick's $14.8 million.<br><br><br>
                                
                                In international markets, the film continues to maintain momentum at the box office. As of Wednesday, the film has earned $75 million total from France alone, with a $3.7 million Thursday gross from China, despite its ongoing COVID-related restrictions, 
                                adding to its $116 million total. Korea also continues to see wide success with the epic science fiction flick with $2.1 million to its total of $62.7 million. Among the other larger markets, the movie has earned a collected total of $52.1 million from Germany alongside $42.4 million from India.</p>

                            <div class="parawed">As 2022 is coming to an end, it’s nice to look back on how our lives have changed over the past few months and how many new things were introduced to the world. 
                                From new memes to new songs, the media just keeps on giving and growing — and we can say the same for the world of TV. There have been a lot of notable TV shows this year from different genres, may it be the likes of Abbott Elementary, Andor, or The Bear, among many others. 
                                What’s for certain is that 2022 has been a wildly successful year for TV.<br><br>

                                One genre that stood out this year is fantasy. These shows effectively kept the fantasy community alive, gaining even more viewers and recognition. 
                                From dragon-slaying to time travel, there are so many things that the fantasy TV genre gave us this year that are of high quality. 
                                This proves that there’s a lot more to tell in the coming years. I mean, who couldn’t get enough of vampires, magicians, fairies, gods, and even a sentient hand? Here are just some of the best fantasy shows that came out this year and essentially dominated our screens and the media.<br><BR><Br>
